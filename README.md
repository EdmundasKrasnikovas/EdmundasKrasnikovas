<h1 align="center"> Welcome Friend! </h1>
<p align="center"> My name is Edmundas, I’m data enthusiast and here you could find more information about me</p>

<p align="center">
<h2></h2>
<p>
For the last few years, I’ve been working heavily with Google Sheets to support day-to-day operations — building relational structures for partner data, creating audit checks, and setting up small workflows with formulas, Looker imports, and Google Apps Script. Later I took full ownership of invoicing for 3.3k+ agents, turning working hours and shift data into transparent financial summaries that stakeholders relied on.
</p>
<p>
Past experience showed me how much impact structured approach and insights can create. That curiosity pushed me to learn more — first through DataCamp, and later at Turing College, where I strengthened my analytical thinking and hands-on problem-solving.
</p>
<p>
I’m moving toward data analytics because I enjoy understanding how things work, spotting patterns, and building solutions that actually help people. I’m looking for opportunities where I can apply what I know while growing through real, practical work. 
</p> 
<p> Below you can find a few projects where I’ve applied my current skills. </p>
